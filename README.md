# DO MY README

## Description

Our Do My README is inspired by people who loves to code and create new apps, but do not have time to elaborate a whole README.. We created this project because this would safe us some time to keep polishing what it matters, apps!. We resolved the time consuming of a well elaborate README.. We learned that just by coming with ideas to write a README, we can spent 20 hours. That's a lot of time!.
