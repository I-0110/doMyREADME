# DO MY README

## Description

Our Do My README is inspired by people who love to code more and write less. . We created this project because we were looking for an alternative that save us some time doing README's while we have more time to make sure our  projects and applications are working fine. . We resolved speding twenty hours building a professional README last time. . We learned that with an app like this one, we can save some time also in other details that we spent extra time, too. Like creating a slide presentation of our projects. (Plans for our next app).
